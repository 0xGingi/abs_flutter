Privacy Policy

1. Data Collection

Our app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. This app operates entirely independently, without gathering any information from its users.

2. Server Communication

The app functions exclusively with its own dedicated server. Any data handled or stored by the server is independent of this app and is managed according to the serverâ€™s separate privacy policies.

3. Local Logs

The app may generate local logs on the user's device. These logs are stored locally and are not automatically shared or transmitted. Sharing of these logs, if necessary, must be done manually by the user. The app does not automatically share or upload these logs to any external servers.

4. User Control

As the user, you have full control over your data. Since the app does not collect or transmit any information, there is no need for data management within the app. Any local logs created are under your control and can be deleted or shared at your discretion.

5. Updates to this Policy

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy as needed to reflect changes in technology or legal requirements. However, the core principle that no data is collected will remain unchanged.

6. Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us.
