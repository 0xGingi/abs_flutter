## Player Settings

### Stop Player Until Sync
> When starting playback (e.g., after a pause), the player will wait until the latest sync is received before starting playback. If this is disabled, the player will start playback immediately, which may cause a slight jump after the start.

### Show Progress per Chapter
> The progress bar will display the progress per chapter instead of the overall progress of the entire item.

### Shake to Reset Sleep Timer
> If the sleep timer is set, you can shake your device to reset the timer.

### Lock Media Progress Bar
> Locks the media progress bar in the notification, preventing accidental changes to the playback progress. This change requires a restart of the app to take effect.

### Fast Forward and Rewind Time
> Sets the time in seconds for fast forward or rewind when the buttons are pressed. This applies to all controls, including notifications.

### Sync Interval
> Sets the interval in seconds to sync the local progress with the server. A recommended setting is 10 seconds to keep progress up to date. If no connection is available or an error occurs, the sync will be saved locally and sent the next time a connection is established.
